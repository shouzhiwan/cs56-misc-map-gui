============================  
(a) 
This is a project of interactive map of UCSB campus. We can either by clicking on which building on campus to get the map of that building or by searching keywords.

As a freshman of UCSB, I can click the building names so that I can find the information about that building.
As a freshman, I can click the buiding name so that I can find where building is.
As a Student, I can search the building by names so that I can get the direction from Ucen to that building.
As a student, I can search the building by abreviations so that I can find its location on the map.

(c)
This software runs well and it allow us to click on the buttons or to search the names or abreviations of a building on UCSB campus to load the maps and find the directions which can direct us from Ucen to that building.

(c)
As a visitor of UCSB, I can move the mouse to the abreviation button so that I can know the full name of that building
As a Student of UYCSB, I can search two building so that I can get the direction from one to the other.
As a visitor of UCSB, I can search the building by department so that I can find the map and direction of that building.

(d)
This README.md tells us what is one possible way to improve this software and what to add to give this software more functions. It would be nice if we discribe aliitle bit how this software works and what is the functionality of each file. Also, after we do some changes, we can include what did we do.

(e)
Every target has a discription so we don't need to add any.And the linenumbers can be deleted. We need to change the quarter to W16 and the author to Shouzhi Wan and Jinfa Zhu.

(f)
There are lots of issues and we plan to do the issue,"Imporve main window GUI #15"300points,"Add a welcome page #16"200points, "Factor Out duplicate code #13"200points,"Building info buttons #17"#200,"Add More Buttons #1"100points.
(g)
"Add routine to selected buildings" https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-misc-map-gui/issues/19

(h)
The Run.java class is the class that will run the program which includes the main method and creates a TheGui object and set up the home screen. The MapStatics.java is the class that creates a hash map that stores the name ands direction informations of each building. The TheGUI.java class links everyt thing together. It creates windows, frames, buttons, and so on. This class create and call ActionListeners and ActionEvents and so on.

(i)     
We don't have a test file for this program. So, If I want to make one, I will test every buttons and check whether the direction is correct or not.
